# Teacher Administration System

## Overview
This project provides a RESTful API for teachers to manage students through basic administrative functions.  

Both teachers and students are identified using their email addresses.


## Database Design

The database schema consists of four main tables:

- **User**: Stores both teachers and students, identified by a unique email.
- **TeacherInfo**: Additional info for teachers (status, year).
- **StudentInfo**: Additional info for students (status, year).
- **TeacherStudent**: A join table representing the relationship between teachers and their registered students.

Relationships:
- Each `TeacherInfo` and `StudentInfo` is associated with `User`.
- Each teacher can register multiple students through the `TeacherStudent` relationship table.

Assumption:
- The `TeacherStudent` relationship is used to represent class membership.
- A separate Class entity was not introduced, as all required operations (e.g., register, suspend, notify) can be effectively handled through this relationship.
- This approach was chosen for simplicity and is aligned with the given API requirements.

👉 See [`database/DDL.sql`](database/DDL.sql) for full table definitions.

### Starting Project Services

This starts the Docker service (MySQL container).

After the database container is up, the schema and seed scripts located in the `database/` folder will be automatically initialized.


```bash
npm run start:services
```

<br>

### Installing Project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

<br>

### Starting Project application 

This will start the application in watch mode.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

<br>

### Health Check
To confirm the API is running locally:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/healthcheck
```
Should return HTTP 200 OK
